    answer:
      'Begin with the end in mind. Information security is becoming a wide area of study with different areas of knowledge. Do you know what area interests you? Begin learning about the field by studying the different fields that comprise information securityâ€”see the resources below. Once you have an idea of what interests you, begin studying that area. There are many different career paths that sound appealing to you. Look at security job descriptions at companies that interest you. What skills do they require? If you do not possess that skill set, how do you obtain it? Align your studies to include these necessary skills. Access to a lab helps solidify academic concepts (e.g., do it, do not just read about it).',
